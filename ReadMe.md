Code to post-process ARISE and G6sulfur simulations into a small archive of time-mean (and stds) maps for a set of the important climate metrics.

UKESM uses a 360 day calendar, so there is no need to apply month weights for annual means. For CESM2 and others, we do need to do this, hence the additional step in meaning in these scripts.
